**Industrial Use Cases and Requirements (AirBus)**

**Objectives**  

The primary objective of this WP is to describe and define the industrial, real life Use Cases and the associated requirements. These Industrial Use Cases will drive and justify all the other activities (WPs) of this project. This objective is broken down into the following sub-objectives:
 * To gather Industrial Use Cases from all the industrial partners. These need to be illustrated by sample material (e.g. pieces of software or system lifecycle documents and/or models) resulting in Corpora.
 * To formalize and prioritize User Requirements (incl. commercial requirements) on ModelWriter platform.
 * To specify the Software Requirements, including the technology to be researched & developed (in WP2, WP3, WP4) and integrated (in WP6) within the ModelWriter platform.
 * To define evaluation methods, incl. identification of metrics to quantify performance of technical authors who do not use ModelWriter yet (="without" ModelWriter), enabling a basis of comparison with WP6.4â€™s evaluation "with" ModelWriter.

**Expected results**

 * Industrial Uses Cases (see Appendix 11 for initial Use Cases), with representative Corpus data
 * User Requirements
 * Software Requirements
 * Detailed description of evaluation methods
